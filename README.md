- Player vs Player and Player vs AI (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- Animations, sound effects, and game piece interactions
- A polished, responsive user interface
- A custom physics-based animation

## Play the Game

### ðŸ”¹ Option 1: App Image (Portable)
Just double-click `Connect4.exe` in the `dist/Connect4App/Connect4/` folder to play the game. No installation is required!

>**Note:** Some systems may prompt with a security warning. This is expected since the app is unsigned and built by a student developer. Click **More Info > Run Anyway** to continue.

### ðŸ”¹ Option 2: Windows Installer
