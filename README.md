Connect4 Local Gameplay
This is a Java implementation of the Connect4 game, which can be played either through a Console interface or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX. 
The game allows users to play against another player or the computer locally on their machine.

Description
The project includes:

A console-based version of the game (ConsoleUI).
A JavaFX GUI-based version (GUI).
Game logic handled by classes in the core package.

Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
JavaFX SDK (if using JDK 11+).

Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal (or command prompt) and clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/wgolden117/connect4_local_gameplay.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd connect4_local_gameplay

Step 2: Download and Set Up JavaFX SDK
If youâ€™re using JDK 11 or higher, download the JavaFX SDK.

Extract the SDK to a location on your system, for example:
C:\path\to\javafx-sdk

Step 3: Compile the Program
Command Line (Windows/macOS/Linux)
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the src directory of the project.
cd src
2. Compile the project:
javac --module-path "C:\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml ui/*.java core/*.java
Replace C:\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib with the path where you downloaded and extracted the JavaFX SDK.

Step 4: Running the Game
Use the following command:
java --module-path "C:\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml ui.ConsoleUI

Step 5: Running in an IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse)
1. Set up your IDE:
Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse).
Add the JavaFX SDK to the project:
In IntelliJ: Go to File > Project Structure > Libraries, click + to add the JavaFX SDK.
In Eclipse: Go to Project > Properties > Java Build Path, and add the JavaFX SDK as an external library.
2. Edit VM Options:

In your IDE's run configuration, add the following VM options to run the JavaFX-based GUI:
--module-path "C:\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
Replace "C:\path\to\javafx-sdk\lib" with the actual path to your JavaFX SDK.

Run the Application:
Select either ConsoleUI or GUI and run it from the IDE.
